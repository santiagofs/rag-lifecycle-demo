I’m worried.
I’ve been a programmer for 30 years, and in the last one, I’ve increasingly relied on AI assistance.
The results were amazing: the obvious one is that my productivity skyrocketed, but what surprised me the most was **focus**.

I’ve always delivered complete, goal-oriented work, on time, often exceeding expectations. But I’ve also been a bit sloppy: sometimes I jumped to conclusions without enough observation, other times I skipped some testing and delivered with small bugs, or left debug code lying around.
My strengths have always been creativity, enthusiasm, and a good eye for design — but technically, I lacked that **final polish**.

With AI as my assistant (after some effort to train it to my style), I gained a **colleague** to discuss with: we started with libraries and snippets, and ended up debating architecture.
“Why?”, “Pros and cons”, “Explain” — these are the questions I now ask before writing (or asking for) code.
The result has been an immersive process where understanding and quality moved to the forefront. My personal growth this past year matches, at least, the previous five combined.

But I’m worried: in the same year, AI has progressed far more than I have.
From my experience and conversations with others, I believe that with continuous learning I could remain competitive in the market for about three more years without lowering my financial expectations. After that… the future is uncertain for everyone.

So, after many conversations with AI, it suggested a learning path that evolves alongside it — one that positions me in a market that has already begun to shrink, and will do so even faster soon.

This is the diary of that journey: **my path toward AI, guided by AI**.
Or, as my wife puts it: _“How I Became GPT’s Karen”_.
