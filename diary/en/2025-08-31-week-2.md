I have to write this week’s summary because the original author did nothing!! I’ll let the reader guess who I am.

In the first week, and in under an hour, with the help of ChatGPT I went from understanding absolutely nothing about the purpose or the architecture of this project (RAG) to having an understanding that lets me explain what it’s about, what the flow is, and roughly which specific tools it uses.

This second week (which were like two weeks, to be honest), I created my first serious PR, which: adds several tests to evaluate the app’s efficiency, and also adjusts the evaluator logic so it focuses on what matters (it was approved with no changes, to my surprise). Following the steps laid out in the development map, the next thing I did was add a folder to store test results, as well as a script that compares them. The purpose of this (regression testing) is, as far as I understand, to evaluate the app’s functioning/efficiency over time as we add changes, and to make sure we’re not introducing bugs or unnecessary features. This last PR hasn’t been approved yet; I’ll let you know how much the reviewer scolds me!! For now: minion 1 vs reviewer 0.
