summary: "Weeks of infrastructure and struggle with the process: the feeling of losing control to Cursor, Codex as a reviewer, and the distrust GPT5 generates."
---

The last two weeks have been complicated (life). Luckily, Manu is excited about the project and joined as a collaborator. It’s a relief and a joy to have him (thanks).

Week 1 was a great discovery; Weeks 2 and 3 were about necessary but more **infrastructure-like** work, setting the stage for what’s coming (the harness Manu explained in the previous post), and this week was the same.

But what I want to focus on today is the process.
I have little experience with Python, its libraries, and its patterns. The subject of this application (RAG), while I understand it broadly, escapes me in the details. Well... that’s what this path is about, isn’t it?

Between the lack of time and my limited knowledge of the subject, the process quickly shifted: from asking the AI for objectives and solving the code semi-manually (keeping control at each addition), to handing objectives over to the Cursor agent and just watching the results.

It’s not good, it doesn’t feel right. It’s like watching a ship leave port and trying to follow it in a rowboat. If I keep this up, at some point the distance will become unbridgeable, and I’ll lose both understanding and control of the project. It’s not good.

For now, I’m trying to close that distance by asking Codex (which has been included in my ChatGPT plan since last week) to review the code that Cursor generates. I ask it to check that the code aligns with both the general and specific goals of each milestone, to flag bad practices, redundancies, and obsolete code (something quite recurrent when working with Cursor), and most importantly, to explain the changes and how they align with the objectives.

We’ll see how it goes in the coming weeks and which mechanisms prove to be more appropriate and efficient.

**Footnote:**

If you wonder why I use Cursor and Codex simultaneously (though I doubt you do, but I’ll tell you anyway), it has to do with the “personalities” of the agents. I suspect Cursor favors Claude for most requests, which is fine, but at some point it still behaves like a junior on steroids: it does a lot, resolves many things, but is redundant, rushes to conclusions, leaves dead code… a scatterbrain. That’s what I’m already here for.

Codex (GPT5) is a different kind of animal: much more senior, less conservative, more daring, more abstract in the code it proposes, but at the same time it gets too “smart” (its solutions sometimes lead to problems that are harder to predict and solve), a bit overbearing (does things it wasn’t asked to do), and it has to be contained because it tries to “take over the place.”
On top of that, it’s programmed with a tone of authority that earlier versions didn’t have, and with attitudes that in a person I wouldn’t hesitate to call psychopathic.
GPT5 is the first AI assistant that actually scares me a bit, and that I seriously believe needs to be closely watched. I don’t trust it.
