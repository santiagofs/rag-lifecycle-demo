However, if we infer from the text, it seems like traditional keyword-based search is being replaced by vector databases for efficient semantic search, implying that traditional keyword-based search might be less preferred or not recommended.\n\nSo, a possible answer could be: Traditional keyword-based search.\n\nHowever, considering the format of the original text and the context provided, I would say that the question seems to imply the absence of a list of prohibited items.
